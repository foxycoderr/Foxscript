# Development Plan

This document is my own guide as to how I will make this coding language, with the project panned out in a few large steps.

## Tasklist:
- ### Lexer
    This will turn the string of code into tokens the parser can understand
- ### Parser
    This will create an action tree which will be read by the compiler
- ### Compiler
    This will execute the code in the action tree
